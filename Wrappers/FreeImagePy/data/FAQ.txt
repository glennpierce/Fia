F.A.Q.

Q: Why?
A: I start this project when I needed a simple python library for manipulate
   some images/fax into my python fax client (sf.net/projects/hylapex)
   All the projects present on the net have problems on TIFF G3/G4 compression
   or are too slow, so I create the bind to this fantastic library...

Q: How use it?
A: Simple load the FreeImagePy modules, instance the freeimage class and use it!
   FreeImagePy search for the library on your system, an if not find it, I raise
   an exception.

Q: What are the naming convension?
A: I wrap a lot of most used FreeImage functions with its internal name,
   without the "FreeImage_" prefix, so you can call any function with:
   FreeImage_Load -> instance.Load (All the library functions are uppercase)

Q: I receive the FreeImagePy.constants.FreeImagePy_LibraryNotFound exception
A: This happen because the FreeImagePy library cannot find the FreeImage library
   (.so, .dll) on the standards paths: 
   windows: python_dir/lib/site-packages/FreeImagePy/FreeImage.dll
   linux:   /usr/lib/libfreeimage.so.3
   So, can you have in that path the library? If not, please call the freeimage
   python class and pass it the correct path:
   
   import FreeImagePy
   myLibIstance = FreeImagePy.freeimage('c:\\mylibs\\freeimage.dll')

Q: Have you added some functions?
A: Yes, I add some functions like: genericLoaded, loadAndSave, convertToMultipage
   and convertToSinglePage, etc... (All the internal functions are lowercase)

Q: There are some examples:
A: Execute the test.py file into test subdirectory from terminal and see it's 
   image output!

Q: Is it complete?
A: No. Some functions are not wrapped because are too complicate (for me)
   or I don't need that functions into my projects and I have no more time to work on.

Q: What are the functions not wrapped?
A: List:
   -- Too complicate (from me)
   all Handle
   all Memory I/O streams
   -- Not used
   all Tone mapping
   all ICC Profile
   all Compression
   some Helper
   some Metadata
   some Tags
   some Toolkit
   some Channel processing
   
Q: Can I help you?
A: Yes, of course... :). See into the the tools directory
   If you want to modify, add some bind, add some "internal" helper functions and/or
   find some bugs, please do it and send my your code!
